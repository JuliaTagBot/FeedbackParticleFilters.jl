# FeedbackParticleFilters.jl
This package provides a versatile and efficient feedback particle filter implementation in Julia, with abstractions to flexibly construct filters for a variety of uni- and multivariate filtering problems with both diffusion and point process observations.

# Installation

In Julia:

```julia
Pkg.add("FeedbackParticleFilters")
```

# Usage

Basic setup might look like this:
```julia
using FeedbackParticleFilters
```

There are various Jupyter notebooks that explain various functionalities:
1. Gain estimation using the [semigroup method](notebooks/Gain_semigroup.ipynb)
